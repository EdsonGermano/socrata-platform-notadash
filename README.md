# notadash

notadash is a dashboard/monitoring service interface for the Mesos/Marathon/Docker stack.  It (will) provide a CLI dashboard
for monitoring the current state of the stack as well as provide a simple tool to use in conjunction with monitoring services
such as [Sensu](http://sensuapp.org/).

This project is currently in heavy development, this README will be updated as the state of the project evolves.
